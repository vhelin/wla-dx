1... WLA GB-Z80/Z80/6502/65C02/65CE02/65816/6800/6801/6809/8008/8080/HUC6280/SPC-700/SuperFX History
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v10.4 (24-Nov-2022) [ALL] If a value is .DEFINEd later in the same source file
                      than used in a pending calculation, WLA can now solve
                      the pending calculation before exporting it to WLALINK.
                    [ALL] Added .SEEDRANDOM (seeds random number generator
                      with current time -> random).
                    [ALL] Added built-in functions min(a,b), max(a,b),
                      random(min,max), sqrt(a), abs(a), cos(a), sin(a), tan(a),
                      acos(a), asin(a), atan(a), atan2(a,b), cosh(a), sinh(a),
                      tanh(a), log(a), log10(a), pow(a,b), sign(a) and
                      clamp(value,min,max).
                    [ALL] When a built-in function was called with a negative
                      sign the sign was ignored sometimes.
                    [ALL] Floating point values can be given to a .MACRO as
                      arguments and accessed via \1 etc., they are not rounded to
                      integers any more. Previously only named args would work
                      without rounding.
                    [ALL] When using a .FUNCTION the result was rounded to
                      an integer - not any more.
                    [ALL] .FUNCTION body can now be a single argument.
                    [ALL] Built-in (and .FUNCTION) arguments can now be put on
                      multiple lines.
                    [ALL] We now use ANSI C's tmpfile() to create tmp files.
                      This should allow multiple concurrent instances of WLA to
                      run in the same directory at the same time.
                    [ALL] When using -M, if you specify -o or -l later on the
                      command line you can output an object or a library file
                      at the same time. Disable file generation with -t.
                    [ALL] A calculation can be split into multiple lines if the
                      last symbol on the line is a '+', '-', '*'. etc.
                    [ALL] Unnamed .STRUCTs inside other .STRUCTs don't generate
                      _paddingof_* definitions any more.
                    [ALL] Pending calculations work now as macro arguments.
                    [ALL] Fixed INSTANCEOF in .ENUM when .STRUCT used SIZE
                      (WLA doesn't generate bytes in that case any more).
                    [ALL] Negating pending calculations inside parentheses inside
                      pending calculations ignored the sign.
                    [ALL] Negating calculations inside parentheses should now
                      work in every case.
                    [ALL] Dotted .INSTANCEOF works now in .ENUMs.

v10.3 (02-Oct-2022) [ALL] Improved parser for .HEX, and added BLOCK to .HEX.
                    [ALL] "\\" should now work inside strings.
                    [ALL] .MACRO calling another .MACRO, inside a namespaced
                      file, should now work.
                    [ALL] .MACRO arguments can now be put inside parentheses
                      when calling a .MACRO (e.g., "MyMacro(1, 2)").
                    [ALL] defined() can now process strings with substitution.
                    [ALL] Added an alternative way of defining a .MACRO
                      (e.g., ".macro SUM(value1,value2) isolated").
                    [ALL] Added .FUNCTION (for things like ".DB SUM(1, 2)").
                    [ALL] Multibyte .DEFINEs (e.g., "MB = $01 $00 $02") were
                      broken in v10.2.
                    [ALL] Multibyte .DEFINEs work now better inside other
                      multibyte .DEFINEs.
                    [ALL] Calculations like ">-VAR" and "2--1" work now,
                      only ">(-VAR)" and "2-(-1)" used to work before.
                    [ALL] Added -v1 and -v2 (shorter verbose levels).
                    [ALL] Changed the license to GPL-2.0-or-later.
                    [ALL] Parameters (SKIP, READ, SWAP, FSIZE and FILTER)
                      to .INCBIN can now be given in any order.
                    [ALL] Parameters (ONCE and NAMESPACE) to .INCLUDE can
                      now be given in any order.
                    [ALL] Parameters (NAME and SIZE) to .ARRAYDEFINE can
                      now be given in any order.
                    [ALL] Negative READ parameter to .INCBIN means that
                      many bytes are not read from the end of the file.
                    [ALL] WLA's ability to calculate A-B would break the
                      execution of the app if A was a definition.
                    [ALL] Added optional keywords COUNT, MIN and MAX to
                      .DBRND and .DWRND.
                    [GB ] Sometimes WLA-GB would generate unused pending
                      calculations when parsing the code, and namespaces would
                      not work in them thus breaking the linking phase.
                    [SPC] Structs should work now better with SPC-700's
                      instructions.
                    [GB ] Added flag aliases (C -> LSS and LST, NC -> GTE
                      and GEQ, NZ -> NEQ, Z -> EQU) to CALL, JP, JR and RET.
                    [Z80] Added flag aliases (C -> LSS and LST, M -> NEG,
                      NC -> GTE and GEQ, NZ -> NEQ, P -> POS, Z -> EQU) to
                      CALL, JP, JR and RET.

v10.2 (24-Jun-2022) [ALL] Added SIZE to .RAMSECTION.
                    [ALL] Added -d to disable WLA's ability to calculate A-B
                      where A and B are labels.
                    [ALL] If SIZE is used with a .SECTION or .RAMSECTION and
                      the section doesn't fit into it, we now issue an error
                      instead of a warning.
                    [ALL] .FOPEN should now work with makefile generation.
                    [ALL] WLA's summary is now printed to stdout instead of
                      stderr.
                    [ALL] Added support for UTF-8 source files (meaning labels,
                      macro names, definitions, etc. can all be UTF-8).
                    [ALL] When .ROMBANKMAP had ROM banks of different sizes,
                      the verbose summary's ROM information was not fully working.
                    [ALL] Memory overwrite messages should now have working
                      line numbers in all cases.
                    [ALL] WLA assembles now "WLAI" library files and "WLAk"
                      object files.
                    [ALL] Labels without ':' can now be used right on the next
                      line after a .MACRO call.
                    [ALL] Added keywords ISOLATED, ISOLATELOCAL and ISOLATEUNNAMED
                      to .MACRO. These make the local and unnamed labels
                      inside a .MACRO to stay inside and not affect the
                      outside world. The same goes for child label stack.
                    [ALL] We now don't do substitution in code that is skipped
                      using .IFs.
                    [ALL] Added SIZE to .DSTRUCT and .STRUCT and to INSTANCEOF
                      in .RAMSECTION and .ENUM.
                    [ALL] If padding is put to a .DSTRUCT or INSTANCEOF in
                      .RAMSECTION or .ENUM, _paddingof_* definition is created
                      unless -s is given.
                    [ALL] Added optional COUNT to INSTANCEOF in .RAMSECTION and
                      .ENUM.
                    [ALL] Added NOLABELS to .DSTRUCT.
                    [ALL] Added round(), floor() and ceil().
                    [Z80] Added "EX HL,DE" (an alias for "EX DE,HL").
                    [Z80] Added "EX HL,(SP)" (an alias for "EX (SP),HL").
                    [Z80] Added "EX IX,(SP)" (an alias for "EX (SP),IX").
                    [Z80] Added "EX IY,(SP)" (an alias for "EX (SP),IY").
                    [658] WDM takes now a byte (i.e., "WDM $12").
                    [651] Removed wla-6510 as wla-6502 can be used for 6510.
                    [650] Added undocumented opcodes to wla-6502.
                    [GB ] It's now possible to set the number of ROM banks to
                      any value larger than 0.
                    [GB ] WARNING: .ROMBANKS / .ROMBANKMAP don't write the ROM
                      size to $0148 any more, use .ROMSIZE for that.
                    [GB ] Added ROMSIZE to .GBHEADER.

v10.1 (19-Feb-2022) [ALL] Arguments to .SECTION and .RAMSECTION can be now
                      given in any order, only the first argument must be the
                      section's name.
                    [ALL] A definition can be substituted with its value in
                      labels (e.g., label_{COUNTER}) and in quoted strings
                      (e.g., {"ID={COUNTER}"}). Note that also label_{COUNTER+1}
                      works.
                    [ALL] Strings can be split to multiple lines using '\'.
                    [ALL] Added WINDOW and BITWINDOW to .SECTION and .RAMSECTION.
                      These can be used to limit where .SECTIONs and
                      .RAMSECTIONs are placed.
                    [ALL] The assembler is now able to calculate A-B where
                      A and B are labels in the same section. Only the linker
                      used to be able to do this.
                    [ALL] WLA assembles now "WLAG" library files and "WLAi"
                      object files.
                    [ALL] Fixed multiple memory leaks. Should now work better
                      on an Amiga.
                    [ALL] .STRINGMAPTABLE works now with makefile generation.
                    [ALL] We don't try to process special characters in
                      filenames in .INCDIR, .INCLUDE, .INCBIN, .FOPEN,
                      .BACKGROUND and .STRINGMAPTABLE.
                    [ALL] .IFs like ".if MINUS_ONE == -1" (negative value on
                      the right side) didn't use to work.
                    [ALL] "JR -" (similar direct jumps to local labels) should
                      work again.
                    [ALL] Sharing a namespace between sections should not make
                      WLA to crash at exit.
                    [ALL] MAX_NAME_LENGTH is now 2047 instead of 255. This
                      change allows longer strings/labels (NOTE: On Amiga
                      and MSDOS the limit is 511, due to limited stack).
                    [ALL] Turned some huge stack allocations into heap
                      allocations.
                    [ALL] \@ should now work in .IFs.
                    [ALL] __label__ should now work better in calculations.
                    [658] The maximum SRAMSIZE in SNES ROM header is now 7
                      instead of 3.
                    [SFX] Fixed "MOVE (xx),Rn" macro instruction parsing. And
                      even currently WLA cannot create a SMS instruction if
                      WLA postpones the argument's handling to WLALINK...
                    [Z80] Added CHECKSUMSIZE and FORCECHECKSUM to .SMSHEADER.

v10.0 (21-Jun-2021) [ALL] WARNING: Precedence of operators in calculations
                      that WLA calculates is now more fine grained and C like.
                    [ALL] WARNING: .ASC didn't map \0 and \x inside a string,
                      but now all bytes given to .ASC are mapped. Consider
                      using .ASCSTR if you don't want to map special
                      characters.
                    [ALL] All strings (inside "") now support \n, \r, \t, \0,
                      \x, \< and \>.
                    [ALL] '\n', '\r', '\t' and '\0' are now supported.
                    [ALL] ASC() has now wider input support: e.g., ASC('\n')
                      and ASC($D) work.
                    [ALL] It's possible to feed a definition's name to a
                      .MACRO by prefixing it with '&', e.g. &definition.
                    [ALL] Use ?1 inside a .MACRO to get the value of the
                      definition given as argument 1 (and prefixed with '&').
                    [ALL] Added support for nameless INSTANCEOFs in
                      .ENUMs, .STRUCTs and .RAMSECTIONs.
                    [ALL] Computations with 32-bit binary values with all 32
                      bits defined work now.
                    [ALL] It's possible to use binary values in command line
                      definitions (e.g., -D VALUE1=%10101010).
                    [ALL] Hexadecimal values can now also be given as 0xABCD,
                      binary values as 0b11110000.
                    [ALL] .FAIL defaults now to exit code 1, and takes an
                      optional exit code (e.g., ".FAIL 2").
                    [ALL] It's now possible to create, read and write into own
                      arrays using .ARRAYDEFINE/.ARRAYDEF/.ARRAYIN/.ARRAYOUT.
                    [ALL] Added .ARRAYDB, .ARRAYDW, .ARRAYDL and .ARRAYDD.
                    [ALL] Added .BITS (like .DB but for bits) and .ENDBITS.
                    [ALL] WLA assembles now "WLAF" library files and "WLAg"
                      object files.
                    [ALL] Added .FILTER (same as .DBM, but doesn't define
                      any bytes).
                    [ALL] Pending calculations inside bankheader sections
                      should work again.
                    [ALL] If an empty .SECTION/.RAMSECTION uses keyword KEEP
                      it is no longer discarded.
                    [ALL] The source section of APPENDTO operation is now
                      linked with its ID, not name, so multiple sources
                      with the same name work now.
                    [ALL] defined(DEF_A) can be used in conditions to ask
                      if DEF_A is defined.
                    [ALL] exists("file.bin") can be used in conditions to
                      ask if "file.bin" exists.
                    [ALL] .IF takes now complex conditions, e.g.,
                      ".IF !defined(ZERO) && defined(ONE) && (ONE > 0)" works.
                    [ALL] Added .ELIF.
                    [ALL] Added ARG_IMMEDIATE to the types of an argument
                      of a .MACRO (asked using e.g., '\?1').
                    [ALL] Added a flag "-k" that forces WLA to keep all
                      empty sections.
                    [ALL] Added AFTER keyword to .SECTION and .RAMSECTION,
                      which makes sections to be placed OFFSET bytes apart.
                    [ALL] Added .FTELL (get the file position).
                    [ALL] Added .FSEEK (set the file position).
                    [ALL] -v prints now more information about the RAM/ROM
                      usage.
                    [ALL] Data generated by .MACROs and .REPEATs is now
                      visible in listfiles.
                    [ALL] Added support for LOBYTE() (get the low byte, bits
                      0-7), HIBYTE() (get the high byte, bits 8-15), LOWORD()
                      (get the low word, bits 0-15), HIWORD() (get the high
                      word, bits 16-31), BANKBYTE() (get the bank byte,

                    [ALL] Un-named labels (like "-", "+" and "__") don't need

                   [ALL] .DSTRUCTs can now be issued without passing values
                     to all struct members (will be init to $00 or
                     .EMPTYFILL).

v9.4 (02-Mar-2008) [ALL] Enhanced the documentation.
                   [ALL] .DEFINE without a definition value, and a .DEFINE
                     that would have an address label as the definition value
                     would make WLA count the linenumbers afterwards wrong.

                     instead of the stdlib's srand() and rand()).
                   [ALL] It's possible to use '\!' to get the name of the
                     currently parsed source file (works like '\@').
                   [Z80] If a pending computation follows "JR" or "DJNZ",

                   [658] If a pending computation follows "BCC", "BCS", "BEQ",
                     "BMI", "BNE", "BPL", "BVC", "BVS", "BRA", "BRL", "PER",
                     all the label references inside are relative.

                   [658] Operand hinting overrides SEP/REP/.INDEX/.ACCU when
                     dealing with immediate value opcodes (now when did this
                     break?), and .8BIT/.16BIT/.24BIT affect only the rest of
                     the opcodes. WARNING! Check your code as this fix may
                     break it.

                   [ALL] WLA defaults to BANK 0 SLOT 0 ORG 0 at startup.
                   [ALL] Added .SLOT.
                   [ALL] .INCDIR, .INCLUDE and .INCBIN try to convert the

                     .DEFINE.
                   [ALL] Many opcodes, which take signed arguments, do not
                     let the user to specify too large values (e.g., -1 cannot
                     be given as $FF any more).
                   [658] Fixed opcodes "MVN" and "MVP".
                   [GB ] It is possible to give "LD HL,(SP-n)" instead of
                     only "LD HL,(SP+n)".
                   [Z80] The minor version number in SDSCTAG should now work
                     properly.
                   [Z80] It is possible to give e.g., "LD A,(IX-1)" (only
                     "LD A,(IX+-1)" used to work).

v8.9 (12-Jun-2003) [ALL] Added .SEED, .DBRND and .DWRND.
                   [ALL] Added lowercase versions of run-time definitions

                   [ALL] Added support for lowercase versions of the
                     following symbols and directives: DEFAULTSLOT,
                     SLOTSIZE, SLOT, .ENDME, .ENDRO, BANKSTOTAL, BANKS,
                     BANKSIZE, .ASM and .ENDASM.
                   [ALL] WLA assembles now "WLAS" library files and "WLAG"
                     object files.
                   [ALL] Used Valgrind to locate memory allocated from the
                     heap that WLA didn't free at exit (good for Amiga users).
                   [ALL] Fixed few error messages to show the address in
                     hexadecimal format instead of decimal.

                   [ALL] Added SUPERFREE sections.
                   [ALL] Macros can now pass their arguments directly to
                     other macros, and passing a computation to a macro
                     doesn't mess up things any more.
                   [ALL] The macros can now take only at max. 16 arguments.
                   [ALL] WLA doesn't crash when it tries to find the correct
                     mnemonic and has to free the very first computation stack.

                   [658] .BASE can now be given before the first .ORG.
                   [658] WLA now automatically sets the 65816 bit in
                     object files. Previously only SNES directives would
                     enable the WLA to do this.
                   [658] .HIROM and .LOROM now override the user's ROM
                     bank map when computing the 24bit addresses and bank
                     references.
                   [GB ] Renamed .COMPUTECHECKSUM to .COMPUTEGBCHECKSUM
                     (.COMPUTECHECKSUM is still recognized, though).
                   [GB ] Renamed .COMPUTECOMPLEMENTCHECK to
                     .COMPUTEGBCOMPLEMENTCHECK (.COMPUTECOMPLEMENTCHECK is
                     still recognized, though).

                   [65c] Added "PHP" ($08) and "PLP" ($28).
                   [65c] Badly placed "RTS" and "RTI" broke the opcode table
                     so sorted the opcodes better this time.
                   [HuC] "DEA" assembled to $3a, $00. Removed the extra $00.
                   [HuC] Added "PHP" ($08) and "PLP" ($28).
                   [HuC] Badly placed "RTS" and "RTI" broke the opcode table
                     so sorted the opcodes better this time.
                   [SPC] Fixed the byte ordering (to test first, branch label
                     next) in "CBNE" ($2E and $DE) and "DBNZ" ($6E).
                   [SPC] "ASL !?" was defined as $CC, fixed to $0C.
                   [ALL] Decimal number parser didn't work with all cases
                     when a dot was encountered.
                   [ALL] Added support for longer filenames (> 63 characters).
                   [ALL] A correctly, but partially written mnemonic would
                     cause WLA to break the assembling, but without giving
                     an error message.
                   [ALL] Fixed a rare bug which caused WLA and WLALINK to
                     disagree on section id numbers.
                   [ALL] WLA assembles now "WLAR" library files and "WLAE"

                   [ALL] Value parsers accept now big (32bit) values.
                     Previously only 16bit (and 24bit for 65816) values
                     were accepted.
                   [ALL] ".ende" works now also (only ".ENDE" used to work).

                   [ALL] Macro and repeat stacks are now dynamic.
                   [Z80] The linenumber in memory references generated by
                     .SDSCTAG was incorrect.
                   [65x] Fixed a case where operand hinting was ignored.

                   [Z80] Added few missing Z80 opcodes (eg. "JP (IY)").
                   [Z80] Fixed a silly bug in .SDSCTAG.
                   [SPC] Renamed "wla-spc" to "wla-spc700".

v8.5 (19-Apr-2002) [ALL] All unidentified free strings were treated as labels.
                     Fixed so that labels can only start at the beginning of
                     a new line.
                   [ALL] Added support for yet another un-named label (__).
                   [ALL] ".endm" works now also (only ".ENDM" used to work).

                     separated tokens inside .IF.
                   [ALL] Updated the documentation (few crucial things were
                     missing).
                   [ALL] Fixed .RAMSECTION to work (was missing since its
                     introduction).
                   [ALL] Internal pass 1 failed to see duplicate labels.

                     (-, --, +, ++, ...).
                   [ALL] Stack calculator can now return strings (and will

                     definition would crash WLA.
                   [SPC] Added support for SPC-700 systems (wla-spc).
                   [658] Class 4 mnemonic ("ADC #x", "LDA #x", etc) decoder
                     handles now labels correctly in 8bit operand mode.
                   [Z80] "SUB (IX+n)" was mistyped as "SUB A, (IX+n)".
                   [Z80] Updated .SDSCTAG to support the version 1.01
                     of SDSC ROM Tag Specification.

                   [ALL] Added XOR-operator (~) support to computations.
                   [658] Fixed "BRL" to work (the fix was partially missing in
                     v8.1 due to a uncareful source tree merge).
                   [658] Fixed "PER" to work.

                   [ALL] WLA doesn't even try to solve any of the label
                     references (even trivial), all that is now left
                     for WLALINK.
                   [65x] Now there are .B, .W and .L versions of all

                   [658] All the SNES ROM information bytes WLA supports
                     obey now .HIROM and .LOROM.
                   [658] Fixed SNES directives.

                     as labels.

v8.0 (19-May-2001) [ALL] Simplified WLA engine a lot by leaving away ROM and
                     program file assembling, and the old, crippled error
                     reporting engine.
                   [ALL] Removed .FOOTER and .HEADER (no longer required).

                     (smaller WLA executables).
                   [ALL] Empty sections get discarded (and labels inside
                     them as well).
                   [ALL] ".IF A==B" works now as well (only ".IF A == B"
                     used to work).
                   [ALL] WLA doesn't strip the size from the section name
                     if the size is explicitly defined.

                     even more compact than before.
                   [Z80] Reordered LD-mnemonics in the mnemonics table a
                     little so all common mnemonics get decoded faster.

v7.7 (12-May-2001) [Z80] Fixed "LD ?,IX" and "LD ?,IY" to "LD (?),IX" and
                     "LD (?),IY".

v7.6 (10-May-2001) [ALL] Not all mnemonics were case insensitive, a bug
                     introduced in the previous release.

v7.5 (07-May-2001) [ALL] Optimized mnemonic decoders a little.
                   [651] Fixed all NOP -mnemonics to work.

                     to future value definitions with .DB and .DW.
                   [ALL] Win32 port uses now PID in the temp file name.
                   [ALL] Fixed few places which could generate incorrect
                     destination memory overwrite warnings.

                     in verbose mode.
                   [ALL] Enhanced .INCBIN.
                   [Z80] Loose strings given to .SDSCTAG don't cause
                     overwrite warnings anymore.
                   [658] Fixed "STZ ?, X" to work (misclassified earlier).
                   [65x] Added new fixed value size mnemonics to the mnemonics
                     tables to speed up the coding and parsing (eg.
                     "CMP.W ?"). Only those mnemonics with multiple argument
                     size choices are affected.
                   [650] Fixed "DEC ?,X" and "DEC ?" to work (misclassified
                     earlier).
                   [658] Added .LOROM, .HIROM and .BASE to help generating

                     starting at $FFC0).

v7.3 (12-Apr-2001) [ALL] Fixed possible problems with bank overflows
                     (bank size wasn't always up to date).
                   [ALL] Preprocessor modifications introduced a bug
                     which trashed included source files.
                   [ALL] Optimized preprocessor even more.

                     checks due to the new multibyte definitions.
                   [Z80] Added .SDSCTAG (SDSC ROM tag).
                   [Z80] Added .SMSTAG (SMS/GG ROM tag).

v7.2 (08-Apr-2001) [ALL] Rewrote the preprocessor code, now it produces
                     much more compact output and is generally faster.

v1.4 (25-May-1999) Renamed nintendo_logo.s to nintendo_logo.i.
                   Fixed nintendo_logo.i Wzonka-Lad-compatible.
                   Fixed pass-texts, as WLA does actually one pass,
                    three of the old ones were made to the WLA's internal data.
                   Added one funky new optcode, "DEBUG", which will
                    translate to $ED (unused in GB-Z80). This one will
                    flash the power light when executed on Wzonka-Lad,
                    my Game Boy emulator. Use it only for debugging!

v1.3 (01-Jan-1999) Enhanced the documents.
                   WLA now shows the unused areas of the ROM file after

v1.0 (10-Jul-2000) The first public release.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4... WLALINK History
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


v5.19 (24-Nov-2022) WLALINK turned doubles into ints too early in computing
                      pending calculations on some cases thus losing
                      precision.

v5.18 (02-Oct-2022) Added -v1 and -v2 (shorter verbose levels).
                    Pending calculations that were marked negative inside
                      pending calculations should now work.
                    Pending calculations that contain pending calculations
                      that are defined in other files should work now.
                    Big optimizations that should help linking projects with
                      lots of sections, pending calculations and/or files.

v5.17 (24-Jun-2022) Added SIZE to [sections] and [ramsections].
                    Added -R (file paths inside link file are relative to
                      linkfile's location).
                    WLALINK's summary is now printed to stdout instead of
                      stderr.
                    WLALINK didn't print verbose mode's summary at the end if
                      listfile writing was enabled, but there was no listfile
                      data.
                    Bankheader sections now have listfile data.
                    Sections that were appended to other sections have now
                      listfile data.
                    Included file in the middle of a source file doesn't
                      kill the listfile data before it in the source file
                      any more.
                    Code outside .SECTIONs has now listfile data.
                    Listfiles contain now line number, base (65816 only),
                      bank, slot, PC and offset in addition to hexadecimal
                      bytes.
                    If .SECTION "A" is using "AFTER "B"", .SECTION "A" will
                      now inherit .SECTION "B"'s .BASE as well.
                    We now skip the generated RAM_USAGE_SLOT_* labels when
                      trying to automatically find load address for a CBMPRG.

v5.16 (19-Feb-2022) Added support for WINDOW and BITWINDOW in .SECTION and
                      .RAMSECTION.
                    Fixed multiple memory leaks. Should now work better
                      on an Amiga.
                    On Windows it was possible that -s actually wrote a WLA
                      symbol file instead of a NOCA$H symbol file.
                    Removed warnings that begin with "COMPUTE_STACK: The
                      passed on SLOT/BANK/BASE changed..." as they were kind
                      of pointless.

v5.15 (21-Jun-2021) Fixed listfile writing when there is no listfile data
                      in object files.
                    It's possible to give binary values in [definitions].
                    Pending 32-bit calculations work now in bankheader
                      sections.
                    Errors should print now properly if it happened in a
                      source file with file ID > 255.
                    If a .SECTION/.RAMSECTION "B" is merged with section "A"
                      using APPENDTO keyword, "SECTIONEND_A" label is moved
                      to the end of the new, bigger section "A" and labels
                      "SECTIONEND_B" and "SECTIONSTART_B" are deleted.
                    Duplicate SECTIONEND_* and SECTIONSTART_* labels (for
                      sections with same names) are no longer renamed.
                    Chaining APPENDTO sections works now, rewrote the
                      APPENDTO/AFTER section sorter.
                    WLALINK now creates symbols RAM_USAGE_SLOT_x_BANK_y_START
                      and RAM_USAGE_SLOT_x_BANK_y_END that contain the
                      addresses of the first and last used bytes in RAM
                      slots/banks. Information is calculated using
                      .RAMSECTIONs.
                    -v prints now more information about the RAM/ROM usage.
                    WLALINK writes now version 2 WLA symbol files.
                    Symbol files created with -S (and -A) contain now object
                      file IDs for entries in [source files v2] and
                      [addr-to-line mapping v2].
                    Listfiles contain now information about .MACROs and
                      .REPEATs.

v5.14 (20-Mar-2021) Fixed buggy symbol file name generation.
                    Fixed SMS checksum calculation if .SMSHEADER is not used.
                    Fixed a couple of bugs in listfile generation.
                    Added -D (don't create _sizeof_* definitions).
                    Defines are no longer written into NO$CASH symbol files.

v5.13 (17-Jun-2020) Added CBM PRG header writing (with flags -t and -a).
                    Added support for ORG/ORGA to [ramsections].
                    Added support for [sections] in linkfile.
                    Added support for section type and priority changing
                      to [ramsections] and [sections].
                    Added -bS and -bE (start and end addresses of the
                      program).
                    Added -nS (don't sort the sections).

v5.12 (22-Dec-2019) Relaxed the checks regarding misc bits (e.g., SNES ROM
                      mode, GB checksum...) when loading the object files.
                    Fixed pending, relative 16-bit and 24-bit calculations.

v5.11 (15-Aug-2019) Defines that contain computations that are issued inside
                      libraries are now handled correctly.

v5.10 (21-Jun-2019) Added support for NO$SNES symbol files.
                    -d discards now also SUPERFREE sections.
                    Added support for prioritizing sections.
                    Fixed the absolute 24bit addresses of .RAMSECTION labels.

   ... version history of v5.7 (02-Mar-2008) - v5.10 (28-Apr-2019)
       is missing...

v5.7 (02-Mar-2008) A reference to a non existing anonymous label inside a
                     pending calculation would crash WLALINK.
                   Taking the bank number of an anonymous label inside a
                     pending calculation would return the label's address.
                   128 was the maximum legal distance to an 8bit reference,
                     fixed this to 127. The same range bug was in bank header
                     section calculations as well.
                   All the output when linking goes to stderr (some info went
                     to stdout, making the lines to mix in UltraEdit(?)).

v5.6 (01-Jan-2006) Anonymous labels don't fool the unused section discarder
                     to think that a section is referenced.
                   WLALINK could find anonymous labels that had been
                     inside discarded sections.
                   WLALINK can output WLA symbol files as well (option 'S').
                   Added more safety checks to anonymous label calculations.
                   Symbol file writers handle .BASE correctly.
                   Fixed SMC header writing (by Tobias Pflug).

v5.5 (30-Jul-2004) Added support for hexadecimal input values using the
                     suffix 'h'.

v5.4 (10-May-2004) SUPERFREE sections are now inserted into the output after
                     all FREE and SEMIFREE sections.
                   All sections are sorted by size and placed in the output
                     by starting from the largest section.
                   Added preliminary support for list files.
                   Added support for operators '>' (get the high byte) and
                     '<' (get the low byte).
                   Supported object file format is now "WLAK" and library
                     file format "WLAV".
                   FREE, SEMIFREE and SUPERFREE sections can be aligned.

v5.3 (23-Nov-2003) When finding the match the distances between anonymous
                     labels are now measured using their positions in the
                     output file, not using line numbers in the source files
                     (fixes anonymous labels inside .REPT).
                   Added "CADDR", label for referencing the current address.
